# CATVENTURES
**My cat's blog journal**

[LIVE SITE](https://catventures-f4l3vlg1l-gvestmann.vercel.app/)

I created this site for my cat (which I actually don't have) using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (React framework), [Prismic](https://prismic.io) (headless CMS) and deployed it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

The styling is very minimal, didn't want to spend to much time on that since the objective was mainly getting the backend up and running. I used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)'s basic styles for the layout.

You can see some code-comments in most files. Those how are probably of the most interest are [index.js](https://github.com/gvestmann/catventures/blob/main/pages/index.js), [layout.js](https://github.com/gvestmann/catventures/blob/main/components/Layout.js) and [_app.js](https://github.com/gvestmann/catventures/blob/main/pages/_app.js).
